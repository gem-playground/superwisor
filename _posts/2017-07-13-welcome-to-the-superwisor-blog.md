Welcome to the Superwisor Blog. Here is a brief description of how to create a new blog post.

This Superwisor serious game will help you manage your students.

Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. You can add new posts there by creating a new text file and saving it with an md extension.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
